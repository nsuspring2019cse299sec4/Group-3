#Project Name: KHUJO

"KHUJO" is an android application which helps people to find the groceries or any kind of items need to buy. It basically helps us to find the location of the nearest shops based on their searched items. Users will login with their email and password and then they have the option to search items. Then our application will locate them the shops containing those products by using Google Map API and give them direction to the shops. There will be a large inventory about the shops and products as well.
