Project Name: 


Introduction

In order to make our life easier and organized we want to build a mobile application that will be helpful in our daily life. A scheduler and a list in our mobile application, which will able to create an event and a shopping list for user. A scheduler or event reminder will help user to create new event in mobile calendar with set of information and time to notify user beforehand. Additional information also can be stored in the event reminder such as event date , time, location, time to notify user etc. Our mobile application will help user to find their shopping item in real-time database system .And able to locate multiple shop’s location that stored these shopping items. Google MAP API has been implemented in our application to get the shops longitude and magnitude direction. With the help of GPS (Global Positioning System is a satellite-based navigation system) user will be  notified of existing nearby store’s location within the range of 3-kilo meter. For example: if user wants to buy a specific desert, it will search in our database with the name of the desert and will look into classification of stored data where this dessert name was saved and in search result it will return the location of the shop where user can able to buy that specific dessert. khujo is a unique mobile application because of it is both shop finder application for specific products and a event reminder application. It can run on both IOS and android operating system device as long it has GPS configuration and stable internet connection.
